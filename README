Groovy2Ruby is a simple tool to translate Groovy code into Ruby code. It is based on the groovy.inspect.swingui.AstNodeToScriptAdapter from the main Groovy distribution.

Status: This works on my Groovy code to get to a reasonable translation. Some things require some massaging, but it will get you a long way to working code.

Usage: Groovy2Ruby.groovy <groovy_file_name>
